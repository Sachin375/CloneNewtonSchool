           <p>Hello Everyone,

            I would like to share my experience of full stack developer course at Newton School 
            
            On a scale of 0-10, I’d definitely give Newton School a 10! What I liked most about Newton School was the individual mentorship concept and the frequent mock interviews. The mentorship sessions helped a lot with my communication skills and increased my confidence. Earlier, I had felt that I was lacking when it came to expressing my logic and code to others, but the mentor sessions greatly helped me in overcoming this. 
            
            The mock interviews prepared me well for the actual interviews - I was ready for all possible scenarios and potential questions. The feedback from the interviews was useful in giving direction to my interview preparation. As a result of all this, I didn’t feel any nervousness or anxiety while appearing for my actual job interviews. It was really amazing!
            
            Apart from this, I enjoyed the weekly competitions that were conducted and found the entire Full Stack Development course interesting. I’d recommend it to anyone looking to learn and enhance their soft skills.</p>

           <p>Appreciation post to this crazy bootcamp I did last year:
            For me, Newton School was literally a unicorn at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic because I wonder what I would have done without them!
            
            My favourite parts about their Full Stack Development course was the massive knowledge growth at the end of each month, frequent motivational talks from the team, and the step-by-step guidance I received on an HRMS project we did. The mentor sessions acted as a filler for anything that got missed out during the instructor sessions and for clearing up any existing doubts. They were also super helpful for mock interviews. 
            
            I started the course with some elementary knowledge but got introduced to many new topics like stack, queues, and hashmap trees which I had never had a chance to learn before. My familiarity with them now will definitely help in the future now. Overall, I had a great experience with Newton School and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn Full Stack Development.</p>
