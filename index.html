                <p>Hello Everyone,

                    I would like to share my experience of full stack developer course at Newton School

                    On a scale of 0-10, I’d definitely give Newton School a 10! What I liked most about Newton School
                    was the individual mentorship concept and the frequent mock interviews. The mentorship sessions
                    helped a lot with my communication skills and increased my confidence. Earlier, I had felt that I
                    was lacking when it came to expressing my logic and code to others, but the mentor sessions greatly
                    helped me in overcoming this.

                    The mock interviews prepared me well for the actual interviews - I was ready for all possible
                    scenarios and potential questions. The feedback from the interviews was useful in giving direction
                    to my interview preparation. As a result of all this, I didn’t feel any nervousness or anxiety while
                    appearing for my actual job interviews. It was really amazing!

                    Apart from this, I enjoyed the weekly competitions that were conducted and found the entire Full
                    Stack Development course interesting. I’d recommend it to anyone looking to learn and enhance their
                    soft skills.</p>
            </div>

                </div>
                <p>Appreciation post to this crazy bootcamp I did last year:
                    For me, Newton School was literally a unicorn at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic because I wonder
                    what I would have done without them!

                    My favourite parts about their Full Stack Development course was the massive knowledge growth at the
                    end of each month, frequent motivational talks from the team, and the step-by-step guidance I
                    received on an HRMS project we did. The mentor sessions acted as a filler for anything that got
                    missed out during the instructor sessions and for clearing up any existing doubts. They were also
                    super helpful for mock interviews.

                    I started the course with some elementary knowledge but got introduced to many new topics like
                    stack, queues, and hashmap trees which I had never had a chance to learn before. My familiarity with
                    them now will definitely help in the future now. Overall, I had a great experience with Newton
                    School and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn Full Stack Development.</p>
